                                    <p>In photography, the “Rule of Thirds" deals with composition. It allows for a photograph to reveal artistic structure. Before we continue watch these fotos and analyze them, use the following questions to notice the details:</p>
                                    <p>Where are the main points of interest in the picture located in relation to the grid lines of the Rule of thirds?</p>
                                    <p>Is the main subject of the picture placed along one of the grid lines or at an intersection?</p>
                                    <p>Does the placement of elements in the picture draw the viewer's eye towards the main subject or points of interest?</p>
                                    <p>In literature as well as in film, there are also rules of structure that apply the Rule of Three.</p>
                                    <p>The Rule of Three in writing will appear in the following poem you will study as well as in The House on Mango Street.</p>
                                    <p>In previous lessons, you have focused on the big picture — the big ideas — that the writers were getting across. You will continue to do this; however, you will take it a step further by analyzing the structure of what you read. First, let's take a look at how the Rule of Three is used in film.</p>
                                    <p>We can say that the Rule of Three is as simple as a story having a beginning, middle, and end. There are three parts, right? Yes, this is a start at looking at structure. Perhaps some would argue that structure in a novel is not as imperative or complex as it is in a poem. It is true that in a traditional story the structure is as simple as having a beginning, middle, and end.</p>
                                    <p>However, The House on Mango Street, which consists of 44 very short chapters/vignettes, each of them with a structure of its own, can be seen as a non-traditional piece of literature. It's sort of like a jigsaw puzzle; we need to figure out a structure to help make sense of the complete book and to bring all the ideas together.</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="fs-2 fw-bold mt-5">Structuring Literature</p>
                                    <p>Think about the overall structure of Part 1 (chapters 1-10) of the book, which dealt with innocence. Next you will be analyzing Part 2 (chapters 11-21), which will move into experience.</p>

                                                <p>Sometimes I think I became the woman I am by accident, nothing prepared the way, not a dramatic, wayward aunt, or moody mother who read Middlemarch, or godmother who whispered, “You can be whatever you want!” and by doing so performed the god-like function of breathing grit into me. Even my own sisters were more concerned with hairdryers and boys than the poems I recited ad nauseum in our shared bedrooms when the lights were out.</p>
                                                <p>You’re making me sick!” my sisters would say as I ranted on, Whitman’s Song of Myself not the best lullaby, I now admit, or Chaucer in middle English which caused many a nightmare fight. “Mami!” they’d called, “She’s doing it again!” Slap of slippers in the hall, door clicks, and lights snapped on. “Why can’t you be considerate for once?” “I am,” I pleaded, “these are sounds, sweet airs …They give delight and–” “Keep it to yourself!” my mother said, which more than anything anyone in my childhood advised turned me to this paper solitude where I both keep things secret and broadcast my heart for all the world to read. And so, through many drafts, I became the woman I kept to myself as I lay awake in that dark bedroom with the lonesome sound of their soft breathing as my sisters slept. — 12 years ago</p>

                                                <p>The White House has disinvited the poets to a cultural tea in honor of poetry after the Secret Service got wind of a plot to fill Mrs. Bush’s ears with anti-war verse. Were they afraid the poets might persuade a sensitive girl who always loved to read, a librarian who stocked the shelves with Poe and Dickinson? Or was she herself afraid to be swayed by the cooing doves, and live at odds with the screaming hawks in her family?</p>

The chef from Baton Rouge is starved for verse uncensored by Homeland Security.</p>
